# Sample instacli.py
#
# This is a sample instacli.py file. Usually sensitive information
# lives here (things like authentication tokens, email addresses, and so on), so this
# file is ignored in this project's .gitignore.
#
# To set this up, rename this file to `instacli.py` and the 'insta'
# alias will function correctly. Also change the variables to match your
# Instapaper credentials.
